Logic for movement:

1. Check the player has selected a valid piece to move
    (This will be based on the "turn" being their colour
2. Check squares are valid for movement
    - Algorithm will have to search:
        - Down, left
        - Down, right
        If king:
            - Up, left
            - Up, right
        If square blocked:
            - Check if square is occupied by opponent
            - If so, check if square behind is empty
            - If so, allow moving piece to square behind
                - Remove opponent piece from board
                - Move player piece to new square
            - If not, invalid move
            If square blocked by own piece:
                - Invalid move
        If reached end row, promote to King
    - If no valid moves, end turn
3. Repeat the algorithm
    - If no valid moves, end turn
    - If valid move, double jump or triple jump, repeat algorithm
    - If no valid moves for opponent, end game
